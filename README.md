## CrossPost - Simplified Social Media Sharing

CrossPost is a mobile application designed to streamline the process of sharing content across multiple social media platforms. In today's digital age, users often maintain multiple accounts on various platforms like Instagram, LinkedIn, and Twitter (X).
